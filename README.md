## Stakeholders

**Stakeholder:** Daisy, a college student who is interested in making friends  

**Goals / Needs**  
1. Quickly find nearby events that match their schedule and personal interests.  
2. Be able to create and host their own events to attract people and make new friends.  
3. Save time by receiving personalized recommendations filtered by distance, age, and event type.  
4. Keep a history/list of past contacts and events so they can reconnect later.  

**Problems / Frustrations**  
1. Current apps often suggest events that are too far away or irrelevant to their interests.  
2. Limited ways to host or promote personal events, making it difficult to gather people for activities.  
3. Too much manual searching is required; users want smarter automatic recommendations.  
4. Following up with people met at events is inconvenient, as existing apps lack a clear way to keep track of past connections.  

## Product Vision Statement
Our product empowers people who seek social connection to quickly discover and join nearby people and events, making it easy to expand their network and engage in meaningful interactions.
